# Windows 95 - Web project

Trying to recreate w95 experience, using only html/css and less js as possible.

This project was initialised summer 2018, to create an "virtual environment".
(Witch can be found on : https://x.clpo.net/). At the begening it was just a simple w95 looking desktop. 

But over the month its became a website with a near real windows 95 experience. This is why today i put my project on github
to find some people who can help me to dev. this website and add functionalities. 

Feel free to send feedback about your experience on my website. 


## BETA 2 - THE BEGINNING OF A NEW ERA

- Im taking the project more and more seriously, so.. some class/id names needed to be changed. Thats the major point in this release. 
- Also i added an "Achievements" page.
- And the link to this github have been modified. One aim to the GitHub itself and the other one to this page, say Hi ! 
- All the music files as been removed and now only one can be found on the desktop.
- The README as been sligthy updated. 

- If you are curious you may find some "artifacts" in the code, i'm currently working on some features not included yet ; like a fullscreen mod, a windows crash or even a video player.
