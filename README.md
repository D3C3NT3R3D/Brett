# Windows 95 - Web project
Trying to recreate w95 experience, using only html/css and less js as possible.

This project was initialised summer 2018, to create an "virtual environment".
(Witch can be found on : https://clpo.net/). At the begening it was just a simple w95 looking desktop. 

But over the month its became a website with a near real windows 95 experience. This is why today i put my project on github
to find some people who can help me to dev. this website and add functionalities.
