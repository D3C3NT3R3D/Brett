# w95project
Trying to recreate w95 experience, using only html/css and less js as possible.

This project was initialised like 5 months ago, to create an "virtual environment" all around my basic wordpress online CV.
(Witch can be found on : https://clpo.net/). At the begening it was just a simple w95 looking desktop. 

But over the month its became a website with a near real windows 95 experience. This is why today i put my project on github
to find some people who can help me to dev. this website and add fonc. 

Feel free to send feedback about your experience on my website. 

New domain name comming as soon as the first release came out.
